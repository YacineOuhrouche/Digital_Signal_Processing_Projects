# 🎧 Noise Cancellation Tool

Welcome to the **Noise Cancellation Tool** — a Python application that uses **spectral subtraction** to reduce unwanted noise from audio recordings.

## ✨ Features

✅ Load audio files for processing  
✅ Apply noise reduction using spectral subtraction  
✅ Preview the cleaned audio directly from the tool  
✅ Save the noise-reduced file for later use

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

| Library  | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Tkinter** | Graphical User Interface (GUI) |
| **PyDub** | Audio file handling |
| **SciPy** | Signal processing (spectral subtraction) |

## 🔎 How It Works

The core noise cancellation algorithm:

1. **Estimates the noise** by analyzing silent segments of the audio.
2. **Performs spectral subtraction** to remove unwanted frequency components.
3. **Outputs cleaner audio**, suitable for speech recordings, podcasts, and more.
